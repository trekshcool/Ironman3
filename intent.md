# Intent

### Shane Black, Director
Shane Black the director of iron man 2 wanted to show the clash between two extremely powerful individuals who have exclusive access to dangerous technologies, this was to show what impact this kind of clash would have on the world and how Tony Stark as a character would react it. He wanted to make a stew of technologies and how they would shift and expand the Marvel world alongside them. Particularly Shane wanted to show the evolution of Iron man's armor which now included electronic implants within Tony Starks body.
